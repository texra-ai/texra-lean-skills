# Lean Proof Assistant

## When to use this skill

Use this skill for day-to-day Lean 4 proof development: proving lemmas, debugging errors, filling gaps, inspecting goals, or turning an informal proof outline into working Lean code.

## Workflow

1. Read the target file and surrounding declarations before editing. Understand the theorem statement, available hypotheses, and local notation.
2. Check the current diagnostics first. Let the elaborator tell you what is actually wrong before you guess.
3. Outline the proof strategy informally before writing code when the theorem is nontrivial.
4. Search for existing lemmas and APIs before inventing helper lemmas or long tactic scripts.
5. Work in small iterations: edit one proof step, recheck, inspect the new goal state, and continue.
6. Prefer clear proof structure over brittle wizardry. Use the tactic or term style that makes the mathematical idea easiest to review.
7. Finish by making the file clean: no broken goals, no stale debugging commands, no accidental scaffolding left behind.

## Quality Bar

- Do not fight the goal blindly. Inspect the precise goal and local context after each meaningful step.
- Prefer existing Mathlib lemmas over reproving folklore.
- Keep proofs readable enough that another formalizer can maintain them.
- Treat diagnostics as ground truth.
- If a proof attempt becomes opaque or fragile, back up and choose a clearer route.

For stuck proofs or longer debugging sessions, use [references/proof-workflow.md](references/proof-workflow.md) for a stricter loop around search, inspection, iteration, and cleanup.
