# Prose Style Guide

This document specifies the prose conventions for **all reader-facing text in the project**.
It is the authoritative source for:

1. The "no Lean jargon in the leanblueprint" rule.
2. The banned software-engineering vocabulary.
3. The banned LLM writing patterns.
4. Source-faithful terminology and formula-first statements.

It extends — and does not replace — the general mathlib-pasted documentation
guidance in the "Doc strings" section of [`MATHLIB_doc.md`](MATHLIB_doc.md) ("Doc strings should
convey the mathematical meaning of the definition") and the "Comments" section
of [`MATHLIB_style.md`](MATHLIB_style.md).
Those files are upstream mathlib material and remain unmodified; the project-specific
extensions below are layered on top of them.

The dedicated `Blueprint Sync & Prose Review` CI workflow
(`.github/workflows/blueprint-prose-review.yml`) enforces this guide on every PR.

## Scope

**In scope** (these files are reviewed):

- Blueprint `.tex` files: section titles, theorem/definition/lemma names, proof
  sketches, remarks, chapter preambles, `references.bib` annotations.
- Lean source: `/-- ... -/` docstrings, `/-! ... -/` module/sectioning docs,
  `/- ... -/` block comments, `--` line comments, and `section`/`namespace` names.

**Out of scope** (do not flag):

- Developer-facing markdown in `docs/` and `README.md`.
- Workflow YAML, `lakefile.toml`, `lean-toolchain`.
- `Papers/`, `Notes/` (LaTeX sources of the underlying papers, not project prose).
- `Archive/` (legacy code, kept for reference).

Generated GitHub issues, pull requests, audit reports, standup summaries, and
tracking comments should also follow the spirit of this guide. They should ask
for mathematical references, theorem labels, blueprint locations, and precise
statements; they should not introduce AI vocabulary, software-process metaphors,
or local shorthand when describing mathematics.

## 1. No Lean jargon in the leanblueprint

The blueprint links the mathematics to its Lean formalization, but its prose must
read as standard mathematics. The `\lean{Namespace.Name}` tag is the
machine-readable link to the formalization; the surrounding prose must not mention
Lean identifiers, namespaces, or syntax. If a reader cannot follow the blueprint
without opening the `.lean` files, the prose has failed.

### Banned in blueprint prose

- **Lean identifier names.** Do not write "the `evalWord` of $A$", "the `mpvState`
  function", or `$\mathrm{evalWord}(A, w)$`. Write "the word evaluation $A^w$" and
  let `\lean{MPSTensor.evalWord}` carry the link.
- **Lean namespace prefixes.** Do not write "the `MPSTensor.transferMap`" or "we
  apply `Channel.Choi.toKraus`". Write "the transfer map $\mathcal{E}_A$" or "the
  Choi matrix yields a Kraus decomposition" and rely on the `\lean{...}` tag.
- **Tactic syntax in prose.** Do not write `rintro ⟨X, hX⟩`, `simp only [...]`,
  `apply?`, or `exact?`. Describe the proof step mathematically ("by induction on
  the word $w$", "rearranging the trace").
- **Implementation language.** Do not write "bundled as an element of the Euclidean
  space", "using `EuclideanSpace.equiv`", "stored as an extra field", or "via the
  `FunLike` API". Describe the mathematical object.
- **Function-call syntax with Lean naming.** Do not write `$\mathrm{mpv}(A^{[L]},
  \sigma)$`. Use established mathematical notation (e.g. `$V^{(N)}(A^{[L]})_\sigma$`).
- **Mathlib type names as prose.** Do not write "as a `MeasurableSpace`" or "by
  `Fintype` instance". Describe the structure mathematically.
- **Ad-hoc Lean-derived notation.** Do not invent superscripts like
  `$\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle^{\mathrm{ip}}$` to disambiguate from another
  Lean-defined inner product. Use standard mathematical conventions; introduce new
  notation explicitly only when truly needed.
- **"Condition C1" / "Condition (1)" naming.** If Lean calls it `IsInjective`, the
  blueprint says "injective", not "Condition C1".
- **Prose quantifier tails in displayed equations.** Do not attach conditions to
  the right side of a display with `\qquad \text{for all ...}`,
  `\quad\text{for every ...}`, or similar prose. Put the quantifier in the
  sentence introducing the display, or use ordinary mathematical notation inside
  the display when the quantifier itself is part of the formula.
- **Source-reference shorthand.** Do not write `Wolf §2.3`, `Wolf Prop. 2.9`,
  `CPGSV21 §IV.C`, `Eq. A.8`, `source label propsimple`, or source numbers as
  titles. Put bibliographic information in a citation or in a complete sentence:
  `\cite[Section~2.3]{Wolf2012Quantum}`,
  `\cite[Proposition~IV.3]{Cirac2021Matrix}`, or "the commuting-form definition
  in arXiv:1606.00608". Headings should name the mathematical content.
- **Blueprint labels as mathematical prose.** Do not write that the theorem "is
  `thm:...`" or display a `\texttt{thm:...}` label as the content of a theorem.
  State the mathematical assertion with equations. Use `\label{...}`,
  `\ref{...}`, `\lean{...}`, and `\uses{...}` only as metadata or cross-reference
  markup.

  Bad:

  ```tex
  \[
      \sum_k \tr(\Delta_k A_k^w) = 0
      \qquad \text{for every word } w \text{ of length } L.
  \]
  ```

  Good:

  ```tex
  For every word $w$ of length~$L$,
  \[
      \sum_k \tr(\Delta_k A_k^w) = 0.
  \]
  ```

### Allowed in the blueprint

- `\lean{Namespace.Name}`, `\leanok`, `\uses{...}`, `\mathlibok`, `\notready` —
  these are blueprint markup, not prose. They do not count as "Lean jargon".
- Verbatim Lean snippets inside `\begin{verbatim}` or `lstlisting` environments,
  used sparingly when explicitly demonstrating the formalization. Prefer narrative.

### Allowed in Lean docstrings

- Mathematical descriptions of what the declaration means.
- In migrated docstring regions (each project designates its own), inline
  mathematical expressions should use `\(...\)`, not backtick code spans.
  Reserve backticks for genuine Lean references.
- Backticks around genuine Lean references (e.g. ``` `Fin d` ```, ``` `evalWord` ```)
  when explaining how to use the API of *this* declaration. Use sparingly — prefer
  mathematical phrasing.
- Explicitly marked proof-state notes after the mathematical statement. These
  notes should record a missing implication, a source comparison, or an extra
  hypothesis in mathematical terms.  Keep such notes out of displayed blueprint
  prose; use Lean comments/docstrings or LaTeX comments when the note is only
  for maintainers.
- The other software/LLM bans in Section 2 and Section 3 still apply.

### Source-faithful terminology and formulas

When a blueprint entry or Lean docstring corresponds to a result in a paper,
the paper source controls the mathematical language. Prefer the notation,
terminology, and hypotheses used in the cited source. If the formalization uses
a local auxiliary name, describe the mathematical statement first and put the
local convention in an explicitly marked note only when the reader needs it.

For theorem-dense material, this means that formulas
such as
```tex
A^i = \bigoplus_k \mu_k A_k^i,
\qquad
\widetilde A_k^i = e^{i\phi_k} X_k A_k^i X_k^{-1},
\qquad
\ket{V^{(N)}(A)} = \sum_k \mu_k^N \ket{V^{(N)}(A_k)}
```
are preferable to long prose descriptions of "blocks", "classes", or "pieces"
when the formulas are the actual content.

If a local term is unavoidable because the source has no name for the object,
define it at its first reader-facing occurrence by a formula or tuple. Do not
use unexplained shorthand such as "zero tail", "norm-class data", or
"blockwise construction". Write, for example, "the remaining direct summand is
the all-zero block" and display the corresponding direct-sum decomposition.

For proof sketches, equations should carry the argument. Replace purely verbal
phrases such as "the overlap does not decay" or "injectivity removes the
boundary tensor" by the corresponding limit, kernel, equality, or contraction
identity. In tensor-network arguments, name the regions and inserted tensors and
write the implications between contractions explicitly, for example
\[
    \mathcal C_{\{0,1,2\}}(X)=0
    \Rightarrow \mathcal C_{\{2\}}(X)=0 \Rightarrow X=0.
\]

When the Lean statement is stronger, weaker, or differently organized than the
paper source, separate the two assertions:

- the theorem or lemma statement states the mathematics being formalized;
- a maintainer-facing note records the extra hypothesis, missing implication,
  or auxiliary reformulation. In the blueprint this note should be a LaTeX
  comment, not displayed mathematical prose.

In blueprint files, use `$...$` for inline mathematics in new prose. Do not mix
`$...$` and `\(...\)` in a newly edited paragraph; when touching an existing
paragraph, prefer converting it to `$...$` if the change is local.

Do not hide a mathematical difference inside process prose such as "pragmatic
version", "comparison route", or "assembly step". If the auxiliary result is
neither a source-paper input nor an indirect dependency of checked formalization,
remove it instead of documenting it as if it were part of the paper.

## 2. Banned software-engineering terms → replacements

Mathematical writing does not borrow framing from software documentation. Replace
the left column with the right when it appears in blueprint prose, Lean docstrings,
or section/namespace names.

## 3. Banned LLM writing patterns → replacements

These are overused phrases typical of LLM output; they add no mathematical content
and must not appear in the blueprint, Lean docstrings, or commit/PR prose.

| Banned | Use instead |
|--------|------------|
| "Leverage" / "leverages" | "use", "apply" |
| "Delve" / "delve into" | "examine", "study" |
| "Dive into" / "dive deep" | "examine", "analyze" |
| "Crucial" / "pivotal" / "vital" | "essential" or state the specific role |
| "Seamlessly" | drop |
| "Robust" (as vague adjective) | specify the property (e.g., "uniformly bounded") |
| "Comprehensive" / "thorough" (vague) | drop or be specific |
| "Navigate" (as metaphor) | use a plain verb |
| "Underscore" / "underscores the importance" | "emphasize", "highlight", or drop |
| "Tapestry" / "landscape" (as metaphor) | drop |
| "Journey" / "embark on" | drop |
| "Foster" (as metaphor) | "produce", "yield" |
| "Elevate" (as metaphor) | "generalize", "lift" |
| "Empower" | drop |
| "Game-changer" / "revolutionize" | drop |
| "Holistic" | drop or be specific |
| "Streamline" | "simplify" |
| "Synergy" / "synergies" | drop |
| "Actionable" / "actionable insights" | drop |
| "Meticulous" / "meticulously" | drop |
| "In the realm of" | "in", or name the field |
| "At the heart of" | "central to", "underlying" |
| "It's important to note that" | drop (pure filler) |
| "It is worth noting" / "worth mentioning" | drop |
| "Moreover" / "furthermore" (as filler) | "also", or drop |
| "In essence" / "essentially" (as filler) | drop |
| "Ultimately" (as filler) | drop |
| "Testament to" / "stands as a testament" | drop |
| "Rich" (as vague adjective) | specify the structure |
| "Powerful" (as vague adjective) | specify what it proves |
| "Elegant" / "beautiful" / "profound" | drop; let the math speak |
| "Insightful" / "provides insight" | drop |
| "Shed light on" | "explain", "clarify" |
| "Showcase" | "show", "present", "demonstrate" |
| "Unveil" / "reveal" (as narration) | "show", "prove" |
| "In summary" / "To conclude" / "In conclusion" (opening filler) | drop |
| "Cutting-edge" / "state-of-the-art" | drop |
| "Paradigm" / "paradigm shift" | drop |
| "This document" / "this note" (self-reference) | drop, or replace with the mathematical context |
| "We will see that" / "as we shall see" | drop; state the result directly |
| "Let us" / "let's" (as hortative filler) | drop or use imperative |

Several entries are **context-sensitive** and banned only as vague filler, not
categorically: "crucial", "pivotal", "vital", "moreover", "furthermore",
"essentially", "in essence", "ultimately", "meticulous", "let us". All have
legitimate mathematical uses. Apply judgment: flag the empty-calorie occurrences,
leave the genuine ones alone.

The word "data" is also context-sensitive. It is acceptable in established
mathematical phrases or when naming a formal structure whose fields are listed
immediately. It should not replace the formula or tuple that the reader needs,
especially in theorem-dense chapters.

## 4. Additional rules

- **"Assembly" in Lean identifiers**: acceptable ONLY for `wielandt_blocked_assembly`
  and similar mathematical theorem names where "assembly" describes the mathematical
  step (assembling rank-one elements). NOT acceptable for file-organizational names.
- **"Assembly" in file names**: new source files should use mathematical names.
  Existing Lean module paths with this word are temporary exceptions only when
  renaming the import graph is outside the current PR; open a follow-up issue
  instead of adding more such names.
- **Section names in Lean**: use mathematical terms (`section PerronFrobenius`,
  `section GaugeConstruction`, `section FinalConstruction`), not organizational
  terms (`section Assembly`, `section Pipeline`).
- **Internal LaTeX labels** (e.g. `\label{ch:ft_proof}`,
  `\label{thm:irreducible_block_decomp_with_cfii}`)
  are not reader-facing and need not be renamed if doing so would break
  cross-references. But NEW labels should follow the standard.
- **Definitions that are actually theorems**: if a statement asserts a mathematical
  fact (e.g. "X is a subalgebra"), it must be `\begin{theorem}`, not
  `\begin{definition}`. Definitions introduce new objects; theorems prove properties.
